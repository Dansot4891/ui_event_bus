- Added support for global UI event dispatching: SnackBars, navigation (Material Navigator), dialogs, and custom callbacks

## [1.0.1]
- ðŸ“– Readme Fix
- I corrected it because there was an error in the README.md file.

## [1.0.2]

  Added `navigatorKey` and `scaffoldMessengerKey` parameters to the `UIGlobalEventBus` constructor, so you can now pass your own global keys for navigation and SnackBar/Dialog control.
